# Curve contract upgrades!

Curve rolls out a new version: [v0.3](https://github.com/curvefi/curve-contract/tree/compounded). It has multiple logging changes, some tweaks to the algorithm (it should give a slightly higher profit), and others. Every feature makes its own commit.

In order to migrate, withdraw everything (100 %) at withdraw from [old contract page](https://compound.curve.fi/withdraw-old.html), and [deposit](https://compound.curve.fi/deposit.html) at the deposit page.

Check out the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_RDvHcTyuk&feature=youtu.be) of the process.

Remember, this is still an alpha software - more migrations, or more changes may occur, smart contract audit and formal verification are still to happen.
